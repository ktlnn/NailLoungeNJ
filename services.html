                                    <strong>Full Balayage</strong>
                                     One extension is applied to EVERY one of your natural lashes that gives the appearance of a fuller more noticeable glam look. This set is perfect for clients who want their lashes a little fuller than natural, but not dramatic. Lash extensions will be a medium or long length. ($140)

                                    <strong>Volume Set</strong> Our Fullest & Longest lasting Set.
