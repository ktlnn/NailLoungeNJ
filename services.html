                            <strong>Mandarin & Mango | Age Defying</strong> Mango contains high levels of retinol, which stimulates the production of elastin and collagen, thereby
                            aiding in self-repair of the skin. Retinol as a molecule is very small and capable of penetrating the skin’s
                            outer layer regenerating the deeper layers that contain collagen and elastin that results in smoother and
                            more elastic skin. Mandarin orange is an antioxidant that helps to nourish and protect the skin, relieving
                            congested skin to promote skin cell turnover to reveal brighter, healthier, younger-looking skin.
                            Mandarin orange's natural antiseptic properties also help to fight against bacteria production. Skin is left
                            feeling soft and looking radiant and renewed.
